# storyApp
This app will display a story depending on the options selected by the user

# Installation
Once cloned, the app should be accessible via Xcode.

# Background
This app is an original stub clone of The App Brewery - thus the AutoLayout and initial view controller has a different author.

The challenge was to use the previously learnt topics to then create a segue app that also uses MVC although that was not the main objective rather:
- The Model View Controller design pattern
- Using Structs
- Working with Arrays (for story scalability)
